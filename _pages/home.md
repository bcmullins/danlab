We are an interdisciplinary research group focused on developing novel techniques at the intersection of computer science, statistics, and environmental sciences.

We focus on the following areas:
- Differential Privacy:  This field ensures that releasing data about a group doesn't reveal sensitive information about any individual within the group. The lab develops methods to analyze scientific data while adhering to strict privacy guarantees.

- Approximate Inference:  Since collecting and analyzing massive scientific datasets can be computationally expensive, the lab explores techniques for drawing accurate conclusions from data using efficient algorithms.

- Environmental Sciences:  The lab collaborates with researchers in various natural science disciplines like ecology, astronomy, and genetics. We apply privacy-preserving and approximate inference methods to real-world scientific problems.

 **We are  looking for passionate new PhD students, Postdocs, and Master students to join the team** [(more info)]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/vacancies) **!**
