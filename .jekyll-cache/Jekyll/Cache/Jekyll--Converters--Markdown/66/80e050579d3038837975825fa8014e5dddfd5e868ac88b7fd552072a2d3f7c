I"Ó<p>We are an interdisciplinary research group focused on developing novel techniques at the intersection of computer science, statistics, and environmental sciences.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/logo.png" width="95%" /></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Differential Privacy:  This field ensures that releasing data about a group doesnâ€™t reveal sensitive information about any individual within the group. The lab develops methods to analyze scientific data while adhering to strict privacy guarantees.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Approximate Inference:  Since collecting and analyzing massive scientific datasets can be computationally expensive, the lab explores techniques for drawing accurate conclusions from data using efficient algorithms.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Environmental Sciences:  The lab collaborates with researchers in various natural science disciplines like ecology, astronomy, and genetics. We apply privacy-preserving and approximate inference methods to real-world scientific problems.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>We are  looking for passionate new PhD students, Postdocs, and Master students to join the team</strong> <a href="http://localhost:4000/vacancies">(more info)</a> <strong>!</strong></p>
