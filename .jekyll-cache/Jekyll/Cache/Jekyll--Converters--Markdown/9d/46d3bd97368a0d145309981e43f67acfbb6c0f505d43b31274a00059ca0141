      <p>Many people wonder: whatâ€™s the deal with birds? This is a common query. Birds are pretty weird. I mean, they have feathers. WTF? Most other animals donâ€™t have feathers. To investigate this issue, I looked at some birds. I looked at a woodpecker, a parrot, and a penguin. They were all pretty weird! In conclusion, we may never know the deal with birds, but further study is warranted.</p>
